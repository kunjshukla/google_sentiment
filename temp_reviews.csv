Our visit to the Starbucks Reserve in New York was an absolutely delightful experience. From the moment we stepped inside, we were impressed by the ambiance – stylish, inviting, and with a truly special atmosphere. Our spot right next to the crackling fireplace was the absolute highlight and made our visit truly exceptional.
Both the service and the quality of the food and drinks were outstanding. The staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. The coffee was expertly prepared, and the offered snacks and small dishes were also excellent.
Overall:
The Starbucks Reserve in New York is much more than just a coffee shop. It's a place where you can relax and indulge in a stylish setting. Our spot by the fireplace, in particular, made our visit unforgettable. Anyone looking for a special coffeehouse experience will be thrilled with this location!",,,,"true","0","Connor H","en","4 weeks ago","2025-03-23T15:51:35.566Z",,"2025-03-25T00:35:37.000Z","Hi Connor!

This is the second one I been to, besides the one in Seattle. The atmosphere is incredible, as it is all things coffee and a lot of bronze. The people there seem to really enjoy their job, and also make the experience very enjoyable as they give good (and patient) advice on what to get and free samples of interesting brews. Speaking of brews, our favorite thing to order is the coffee flight, which you can order in multiple different brewing methods, each which gives a different flavor. The flights also come with a lot of coffee for two people. The food is also good, but we did only order one item, but it was amazing. The only knock I would give the place is that it can be impossible to find seats at times. This venue was much less busy than the Seattle, but still I would recommend coming very early to get a seat.

My sister ordered a mocha, and it was rich, smooth, and not too sweet. Alongside it, we shared a chocolate hazelnut croissant, which was flaky, buttery, and filled with just the right amount of nutty chocolate goodness. The avocado toast with eggs was also a standout; fresh, creamy avocado paired with perfectly cooked eggs on crisp bread.

The atmosphere was vibrant yet cozy, making it a great spot to relax and enjoy a high-quality coffee experience.",,,,"true","0","Deepty Murthy (13)","en","a month ago","2025-03-21T14:38:27.330Z",,"2025-03-23T17:34:49.000Z","Hello!

The vibe is great in evenings too but it’s v crowded.

Coffee and gifts: amazing variety of coffee to order and take 🫘 too. Ethiopian drip coffee was the best. Nothing beats Starbucks menu of coffee.☕️. The gifts as souvenirs is many . I loved the spring collection of coffee cups , bands and accessories. This is 💯 money well spent

Cocktails: Signature Espresso Martinis 🍸 is a must try and definitely have a few more on my list.

Snacks: looks pretty but croissant was not good. I think they should keep the store original than fancy ok tasting menu. Sweets snacks like cake, donut were decent  and savory snacks were blah",,,,"true","0","Chaim Poper","en","2 months ago","2025-02-20T20:16:51.418Z",,"2025-02-25T17:08:06.000Z","Hello!

One of only six worldwide (including Shanghai, Milan, and Tokyo), it offers a unique and upscale Starbucks experience. Spanning four floors, it freshly roasts beans from diverse sources, allowing visitors to sample and purchase exclusive blends not found at regular Starbucks locations. The store also features high-quality merchandise and delicious pastries.

We opted for the $60 ""experience,"" which included a guided coffee tasting, a tour of the roasting process, a presentation on Starbucks’ history, and a bag of freshly roasted beans. While enjoyable and informative, much of it can be experienced simply by exploring the space and engaging with the knowledgeable staff, making the price hard to justify for everyone.

Despite this, the Roastery itself is absolutely worth a visit. The atmosphere is vibrant, the coffee is exceptional, and the scale of the operation is impressive. Expect to pay a premium, but if you're looking for a truly special coffee experience, this place delivers.

The staff? Absolutely on point. They didn't just serve the drinks; they made the experience unforgettable. With a detailed rundown of the flight and tips on how to savor every drop, they made me feel like I was being treated to a VIP experience.

One had orange and cocoa infused, one had pepper and mole, and the third was a pumpkin spice (we went in October). I don’t like espresso martinis I find them sweet but these were exactly what I wanted. Coffee and natural flavor forward and not heavy on the added sugars or cream/baileys like usual.

The staff at the Arriviamo Bar are great!

The Prosciutto & Parmigiano-Reggiano on Herb Cornetto was phenomenal! A little salty, nutty & perfectly complimented the rosemary herb crust.

The best tasting & most well-balanced drink was the Lavender Matcha Margarita. It's best drunk through a straw, since the foam is so thick. I would ask for less foam next time & a fresh lime to squeeze.

The Butterfly Tea Spritz was lackluster & slightly off putting, in regards to flavor.

The Sakura Blossom Negroni also left much to be desired. It tasted like weak tea mixed w/ Campari.

The Strawberry Lemon Tart was good, but lacked the tang of any lemon flavor.

Go for the Cornetto & Margarita!",,,,"true","0","Ben Park","en","a month ago","2025-03-01T18:26:29.715Z",,"2025-03-06T18:55:36.000Z","Hello! We're grateful that you shared this experience with us.

Located in the Meatpacking District, this place isn’t your average Starbucks. It’s a full on coffee experience. The space itself is stunning with warm wood, copper accents, and an industrial-chic vibe that feels both cozy and ultra cool. It’s like a coffee lab meets a boutique café.
The menu here goes way beyond your typical latte. We’re talking small lot Reserve coffees, tasting flights, specialty brews made with siphons and Chemex, and even coffee inspired cocktails at the in house bar. Everything is crafted with serious attention to detail. You’ll taste flavors in coffee you didn’t even know were possible.
The food’s on another level too with fresh pastries, small plates, and desserts that pair perfectly with your drink of choice. It’s the kind of place you come to hang out, take it slow, and savor the whole experience. My first reserve experience 👏
Whether you’re geeking out over single origin espresso or just want a killer cappuccino in a stunning space, the Starbucks Roastery NYC is absolutely worth the visit.

My wife and I have been to every reserve in America and even though Chicago is our favorite, this was the first one we had ever been to so it holds special place to us. I love their bourbon barrel whiskey cold brew (Alcohol free) and their experimental drinks you can only get at a reserve.

the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in NYC, and wow, it was anything but your typical coffee shop stop. We jumped into the Coffee Lab experience where Patrick and Ella chatted us up about different brewing techniques and coffee roasting secrets. They showcased the Chemex method, which was pretty cool to see in action!

The exclusive micro-blends they served were mind-blowing. Plus, those local truffles from Brooklyn added a sweet twist to the whole coffee story.

Watching the beans roast was an incredible sight. They’ve got this high-tech system that whisks the beans via a vacuum straight to the coffee bars. So intriguing!

Now, let’s talk about the delicious bits: the espresso martini flight was a standout. My fave was the Limoncello martini—just the right amount of zest. Tried a spicy and an orange variation too, mixing things up. Pair that with some scrumptious bites like the tart, tiramisu, avocado toast, and specialty pizza, and you've got food heaven.

The exclusive merch was hard to resist. Perfect for picking up something unique. Oh, and gotta mention the bathrooms—surprisingly on point!

So whether you're a coffee geek or just out for some NYC fun, this roastery is a must-see. You don't need to do a full-on tour; just explore around, sip some fantastic drinks, and soak up the coffee vibe. I'm totally bringing my mom next time she visits—it’s a coffee lover's dream!",,,,"true","0","Frank Zocco","en","3 months ago","2025-01-01T23:02:35.428Z",,"2025-01-06T18:29:46.000Z","Hello!

Their seatings were somewhat limited but when you go to the arriviamo bar, you can get on a waitlist to be seated at the bar but the lower level is a first come first serve basis seating and it'll take some time for you to get seated if its super packed!

They have a HUGE variety of foods for you to try from pizza to dessert- all of them were so GOOD! I recommend trying their pizza but their raspberry cheesecake was a TOP TIER.

Their espresso martini flight was a bit of a disappointment because in Tokyo reserve roastery, I could pick which coffee beans I wanted and there was 3 to choose from but in NYC reserve roastery, I don't think there's a choice because they didn't offer me the option for the coffee beans.

They have huge merchandises that you won't typically see in your local Starbucks so I suggest you grab something for a remembrance.

They have a wonderful amount of coffee beans to buy and I particularly picked Guatemala during my visit...I recommend checking it out as well!

Overall, this is a great location, the food and pastry was a top notch. Would love to come back again but perhaps the martini flight would be a bit too much for me.",,,,"true","0","Dean","en","a month ago","2025-03-02T22:23:39.206Z",,,,"Other","$10–20","Dine in","5","5","5","ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRM0lhYnFnRRAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJK97pX4btO-TUZPUVX73hkgfnR3V7F4uif8_aDESo3x1RqCVIhVNedAuyl9Zw1L69v_2X5sBJxknmvJeDzWt0TtquHo33tcG-_bEQXhww00ieftWzpxVchJ87F4URWUM1NXpszC","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIQwfSiCW1WL4tUpWVlZdAld17cOY3-36SML9L4O2YW0u04Q37WgtLpP1UCsifVG324Xg9jQKJunQ0_2KW9SE6qfx4xo3tUKRRvpTXzOY8Z5F2Yog95RlOjer-04_gvbTyesV0","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIMUt6mrH2MQHMPGxy3Txzma6yuBxUz94TNeqZ32hZEPsIaJogQb_g15uNIBZ9-gyvKcumljDl5A0WkfuQUaIWoZfbdIxrXxEaqvGM-gFB8Aew_8_3CfdScXp5tbUM_Gsxj1grqaQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJLNKenCnddwkmw-fR01FXIeNbSvnhAxILVVYdnZAlejPo3jswInKisJBWkEmdEW0Z_9Qaud182q-wtedE9IkGj87RqNYwSjPGCAXJK4R-g9xkZq2Wat-XgNiV1mArMSqNpUD1jQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJI-ejw66m-akauHZtvHLOX3PRZc5cT0yEHgqCINFsMS_JsYEjlgHsGdZmHBY9MkpjavuWs2jy6bwKQexwgTlHMU50idw_eePK5bUhbfWDNa6I55xjZneZUWbjRE1JKC0dXwRYbfyA","Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRM0lhYnFnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x645ce21be1b31735!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCQ3IabqgE%7CCgsI67STvgYQiMadYg%7C?hl=en","116281405244177216718","69","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUWhPrXJ9QadwFph2tfOU_x7WDRF6J5-6IXYXc3eBLCI4zJk8-C=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116281405244177216718?hl=en","5","“Amazing coffee experience!

Entering these Roasters are always a treat since there’s only 6 reserves all around the world!! The assorted pastries are also a treat since they’re very different from regular Starbucks coffee shops, so I had to try me a delicious cannoli that was just absolutely amazing!
If you’re ever visiting the Chelsea area do make a stop to this lovely Starbucks Reserve, I’m always a fan/supporter of these amazing locations ☺️ not your average coffee shop experience but more!!!",,,,"5793","3978","818","500","288","209","116","whiskey","105","espresso martini","102","flight","91","chelsea market","66","souvenirs","58","barrel aged","15","siphon","13","empire state building","13","unisex","12","copper","2025-04-22T19:38:49.857Z","https://www.google.com/maps/search/Starbucks%20New%20York/@40.54127033152626,-74.11611377632701,15z?hl=en","Starbucks New York",,"New York","61 9th Ave",,"opentable.com","https://www.opentable.com/restaurant/profile/1346173?ref=1068","false","Starbucks Reserve Roastery New York","4.3","en","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKz8LLsibTGOz4f_7oAVo0iGXNfgDqil_9Nf-q0qJwsUDGZhxYp3ilEzdM-iq-vA1vomyVFaOdkexo4fkuFWChytASKfpuVYMTWpkzziFCjllCuCsCCp0gPbFRDLQrLIk9-NN0","2 months ago","2 months ago","Roseann (Haniyyah)","Local Guide","118","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111051933506551156522?hl=en-US","Roasting at the Reserve.","https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Starbucks%20Reserve%20Roastery%20New%20York&query_place_id=ChIJIQDZbb9ZwokRNRez4RviXGQ",,"https://www.starbucksreserve.com/locations/new-york-roastery"
